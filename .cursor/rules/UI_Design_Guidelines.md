## UI/UX Design Guidelines

### Simplicity and Engagement
- **Minimal Distractions:** Keep screens clean with only essential elements
- **Big, Bold Fonts:** Ensure easy readability for kids
- **Bright Colors:** Use engaging colors without overwhelming the user
- **Large Buttons:** Easy-to-tap answer choices
- **Animations:** Subtle effects (e.g., correct answer glow, level-up pop-ups)
- **Instant Feedback:** Show success/failure messages immediately
- **Encouragement Elements:** Use positive reinforcement (stars, badges, fun sounds)
- **Limited Choices:** Restrict UI options per screen to avoid confusion

### Mobile-Specific Considerations
- **Touch-Friendly UI:** Ensure all interactions are optimized for touchscreens
- **Responsive Design:** Works across different screen sizes without breaking UI
- **No Hover Effects:** Avoid features requiring mouse interactions

This ensures a seamless, engaging, and mobile-first experience for kids while keeping development efficient.
